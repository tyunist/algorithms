* This includes two implementations of Floyd Warshall algorithm for all pair shortest path problem.
	* /src/all_stp_linkedlist : implements graph using linked list

	* /src/all_stp_matrix: using adjacent matrix to imploy graph

* To run the program, first initialize a graph by editting file /src/graph.txt. 
This first line of the file is the number presenting the number of nodes in
graph. 
The remaining lines are just a graph representation of the undirected, weighted 
graph.
